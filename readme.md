<h1>Demo Actions plugin</h1>

The *Demo Actions* plugin is a demo or &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; plugin. For a (self-)educational purpose.

It illustrates that: If you can write some program of any size in Java, you can write a plugin.

The menu item *Buttons AB Demo* opens the dockable window with two buttons on a panel.

The menu item *Threads Demo* opens the frame with the title *Threads Demo Input Dialog*.
The fields of this dialog serve to get input to two runnables running in parallel threads.
The runnables loop appending strings into one StringBuffer which is finally
inserted in a new buffer of jEdit.

The menu item *List Engines* inserts in a new buffer the list of scripting engines that
are "visible" from the plugin.
